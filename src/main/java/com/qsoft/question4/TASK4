The class that controls it takes a few basic commands. The co- ordinates (0,0) represent the
lower-left corner of the machine. x and y increase as you move toward the upper-right corner,
whose coordinates are x = getTableSize().width - 1 and y = getTableSize().height - 1.

There are some real-world constraints that might be interest- ing:
you can’t sew thin air, of course, and you can’t sew a workpiece bigger than the machine.
Given these requirements, what boundary conditions can you think of?
